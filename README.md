SimSnake
========

An evolutionary genetic-algorithm that attempts to solve the "Snake Game", where genes
are an instruction set with data. This simulation is hooked up to a real-world 32x32 LED
screen, which is used as a screen-saver / desktop toy.

Note that there are a few random implementations of snake AI code to get you started
with. Those script files are written in assembly-like syntax, but without goto / label
mechanisms.

Todo
====

+ Add Linux and Windows support (this is an XCode / OSX project)
+ Add fitness based off of efficiency (pellets ate, life duration, etc.)
+ Add gene breeding and mutation code
